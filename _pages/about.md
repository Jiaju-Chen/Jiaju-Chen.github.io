## About Me

I am a second-year Master's student at the USTC [Lab for Data Science](https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. [Xiangnan He](https://hexiangnan.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of **Recommender Systems (RecSys)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a focus on enhancing user experiences through intelligent, personalized recommendations.

Currently, I am also working as a research intern at **Kuaishou Technology**, where I contribute to the development and optimization of recommendation algorithms that directly impact millions of users.

## Research Interests

My research aims to bridge the gap between user preferences and content delivery by:

- **LLM-Powered Recommendations**: Leveraging large language models to generate more contextually aware and diverse recommendations
- **Treatment Effect Estimation**: Applying causal inference techniques to understand and optimize user interest exploration
- **Controllable Recommendation Systems**: Developing frameworks that allow fine-grained control over recommendation diversity and personalization
- **User Behavior Modeling**: Understanding implicit user interests and improving engagement through data-driven insights

## Recent Highlights

🎉 **[Jan 2025]** Our paper "DLCRec: A Novel Approach for Managing Diversity in LLM-Based Recommender Systems" has been accepted by **WSDM 2025**!

🎉 **[Jul 2024]** Presented our work "Treatment Effect Estimation for User Interest Exploration" at **SIGIR 2024** in Washington, D.C.

🏆 **[Impact]** At Kuaishou, our recommendation algorithms achieved significant improvements:
- Average app time: **+0.120%**
- User engagement metrics: Follow rate **+1.002%**, Forward rate **+0.984%**
- Reduced negative feedback by **-2.627%**

## Featured Publications

My work has been published at top-tier conferences in information retrieval and data mining, including **SIGIR** and **WSDM**. I focus on developing practical solutions that balance recommendation accuracy with diversity, ensuring users discover content that truly matches their evolving interests.
