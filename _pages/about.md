## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) [Lab for Data Science](https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. [Xiangnan He](https://hexiangnan.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of **LLM agent** and **Data Mining**, with a focus on assisting user experiences on academic research and recommendations with LLMs.

Currently, I am also working as a research intern at **Kuaishou Technology**, where I contribute to the development and optimization of recommendation algorithms that directly impact millions of users.

## Research Interests

My research aims to bridge the gap between user preferences and content delivery by:

- **LLM-Powered Recommendations**: Leveraging large language models to generate more contextually aware and diverse recommendations
- **Treatment Effect Estimation**: Applying causal inference techniques to understand and optimize user interest exploration
- **Controllable Recommendation Systems**: Developing frameworks that allow fine-grained control over recommendation diversity and personalization
- **User Behavior Modeling**: Understanding implicit user interests and improving engagement through data-driven insights

## Recent Highlights

🎉 **[Jan 2025]** Our paper "DLCRec: A Novel Approach for Managing Diversity in LLM-Based Recommender Systems" has been accepted by **WSDM 2025**!

🎉 **[Jul 2024]** Presented our work "Treatment Effect Estimation for User Interest Exploration" at **SIGIR 2024** in Washington, D.C.

🏆 **[Impact]** At Kuaishou, our recommendation algorithms achieved significant improvements: Average app time: **+0.120%** | Follow rate: **+1.002%** | Forward rate: **+0.984%** | Download rate: **+1.018%** | Collection rate: **+1.102%** | Negative feedback: **-2.627%**

## Featured Publications

My work has been published at top-tier conferences in information retrieval and data mining, including **SIGIR** and **WSDM**. I focus on developing practical solutions that balance recommendation accuracy with diversity, ensuring users discover content that truly matches their evolving interests.
