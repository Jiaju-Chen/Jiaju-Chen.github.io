## About Me

I am a PhD student at the USTC [Lab for Data Science](https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiangnan He](https://hexiangnan.github.io/). My research focuses on **LLM Agent** and **Data Mining**, with particular interest in developing intelligent systems that can autonomously reason and interact with complex environments.

I am also a joint-training PhD student at **Zhongguancun Academy** in Beijing, where I conduct research on economic simulation using advanced AI techniques.
