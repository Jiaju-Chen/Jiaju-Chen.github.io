## Research Overview

My research sits at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Recommender Systems (RecSys)**, with a vision to create intelligent systems that truly understand and serve user needs. I'm particularly passionate about addressing the fundamental challenges in modern recommendation systems: balancing accuracy with diversity, exploring hidden user interests, and leveraging the power of LLMs for more nuanced, controllable recommendations.

## Research Interests

### 🤖 LLM-Powered Recommendation Systems

Exploring how large language models can revolutionize recommender systems through:
- **Semantic Understanding**: Leveraging LLMs' deep language comprehension for better content understanding
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Creating recommendations that consider user context and intent
- **Controllable Generation**: Enabling fine-grained control over recommendation properties
- **Prompt Engineering**: Designing effective prompts for recommendation tasks

**Key Work:** [DLCRec (WSDM 2025)](/publication/WSDM'25) - A novel framework for managing diversity in LLM-based recommendations through fine-grained task decomposition.

### 📊 Causal Inference for Recommendations

Applying causal inference techniques to understand and optimize user-item interactions:
- **Treatment Effect Estimation**: Quantifying the impact of different recommendation strategies
- **Hidden Interest Discovery**: Uncovering user preferences beyond observed behavior
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Strategically allocating recommendations across content categories
- **Bias Mitigation**: Using inverse propensity weighting and other techniques to reduce confounding

**Key Work:** [UpliftRec (SIGIR 2024)](/publication/SIGIR'24) - An uplift model-based framework that optimizes category exposure through treatment effect estimation.

### 🎯 Diversity and Controllability

Developing methods to give users more control over their recommendation experience:
- **Controllable Diversity**: Allowing users to specify desired levels of recommendation diversity
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing accuracy, diversity, novelty, and other metrics
- **User Intent Modeling**: Understanding and respecting user preferences for exploration vs. exploitation
- **Fairness-Aware Recommendations**: Ensuring equitable exposure across content providers

### 🔬 User Behavior Modeling

Understanding the complexities of user interactions with recommender systems:
- **Implicit Feedback Processing**: Extracting signals from clicks, dwell time, and other implicit indicators
- **Long-Term User Satisfaction**: Optimizing for sustained engagement rather than short-term metrics
- **Interest Evolution**: Modeling how user preferences change over time
- **Cold Start Problems**: Handling new users and items effectively

## Future Directions

I'm excited about several emerging research directions:

1. **Multi-Modal Recommendations**: Integrating text, images, and video understanding through LLMs
2. **Explainable AI**: Making LLM-based recommendations more interpretable and trustworthy
3. **Personalized LLM Fine-Tuning**: Adapting LLMs to individual user preferences
4. **Cross-Domain Recommendations**: Transferring knowledge across different content domains
5. **Ethical AI**: Addressing fairness, privacy, and transparency challenges
