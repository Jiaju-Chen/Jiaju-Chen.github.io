## Research Interests

### LLM Agent

Developing autonomous agents powered by large language models:

- Autonomous Reasoning: Building agents that can independently analyze problems and make decisions
- Multi-Agent Systems: Designing collaborative frameworks where multiple agents interact
- Tool Learning: Enabling LLMs to effectively use external tools and APIs
- Economic Simulation: Applying LLM agents to model economic behaviors and market dynamics

### Data Mining

Extracting meaningful patterns and insights from large-scale data:

- Pattern Discovery: Uncovering hidden structures in complex datasets
- Causal Inference: Understanding cause-effect relationships in observational data
- User Behavior Analysis: Mining insights from user interaction patterns
- Scalable Algorithms: Developing efficient methods for large-scale data processing

### Recommender Systems

Building intelligent systems for personalized content delivery:

- Diversity Management: Balancing accuracy with content diversity
- Treatment Effect Estimation: Applying causal methods to optimize recommendations
- LLM Integration: Leveraging language models for semantic understanding
- Production Deployment: Scaling algorithms to serve millions of users
